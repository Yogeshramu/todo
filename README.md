# React To-Do Application with Firebase Authentication

This is a To-Do list application built with **React**, **Redux**, and **Firebase Authentication**. The app allows users to manage tasks under different categories such as **To Do**, **Doing**, and **Done**. Users can log in to manage their tasks and log out to secure their data. The app also features task prioritization, persistence using **localStorage**, and a responsive UI.

---

## Features

- **Authentication**: Firebase-based user authentication with login and logout functionality.
- **Task Management**: 
  - Add, delete, and categorize tasks (To Do, Doing, Done).
  - Prioritize tasks (High, Medium, Low).
  - Task list is persistent across sessions using **localStorage**.
- **State Management**: **Redux** for handling state across the application.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design, making it responsive across devices using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.
- **API Integration**: Integrated a weather API to display weather conditions for outdoor tasks.
- **Task Sorting**: Display tasks based on priority, with color coding for different priorities.

---

## Technologies Used

- **React** (with Hooks)
- **Redux** (for state management)
- **Firebase Authentication** (for user authentication)
- **CSS3** (for styling)
- **Redux Thunk** (for handling asynchronous actions like API calls)
- **Weather API** (for integrating weather data relevant to tasks)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (version 14 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn** (package managers)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-todo-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd react-todo-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Set up Firebase Authentication:
   - Create a project in Firebase: [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable **Email/Password Authentication** in the Firebase console.
   - Get your Firebase project’s configuration details and replace them in the `firebase.js` file inside the `src/components` directory.

5. Run the app locally:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or with yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

6. The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Login**: Use the login page to authenticate users via Firebase.
- **Manage Tasks**: Once logged in, users can:
  - Add tasks (with a priority).
  - Move tasks between **To Do**, **Doing**, and **Done** categories.
  - Delete tasks.
  - See real-time weather data for tasks related to outdoor activities.
- **Logout**: Users can log out to end their session.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **State Management**: Managing the tasks state with Redux made the application scalable and maintainable, especially when handling asynchronous data (e.g., API calls).
- **Responsive Design**: The app’s mobile-first approach ensures it works seamlessly on any device, providing a good user experience.
- **Firebase Integration**: Implementing Firebase Authentication allowed users to securely manage their tasks.
